 JobCards is a simple app with authentication which allows users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. It provides access to protected routes only for authenticated users. 
 The app is a simple tool that will help you organise and track your jobs. 
  You can add, edit, and delete jobs as needed. For each job you can add a title, details and the date will be added automatically. 
  Also, you can add photos for each job separately which will help you to remember what needs to be done. 
  The jobs are stored on the server, so they will persist even if you close your browser. You can also mark jobs as completed.

  This is a MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) stack application. The front end of the app is developed with React and uses React Router for client-side routing, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.
  The backend is developed with Node.js and Express and uses MongoDB as the DB as well as Firebase. JSON Web Tokens are used for the implementation of the authentication and the password is hashed and stored in the database using bcrypt.

  The app is a work in progress, and I plan to add more features in the future. I hope you enjoy using the app!
